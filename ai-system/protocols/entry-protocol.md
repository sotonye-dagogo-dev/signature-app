> **Overview:** The mandatory entry procedure for every AI session. Read this first before any other file. It defines how to discover available tools, which docs to load based on context budget, and how to start any session correctly.

## Session Start Procedure

1. **Discover available tools.** Before assuming any capability is unavailable, query the current session for available tools / MCP servers. Common capabilities: filesystem read/write, git introspection, test execution, search, linting, package management. Use these tools for ground-truth operations (live git status, actual file contents) rather than trusting cached docs blindly.

2. **Read the tier-1 core** (mandatory, always read, ~1.5k tokens total):
   - `ai-context.md` — 30-second project orientation
   - `protocols/context-tiering.md` — what to read next, based on task
   - `protocols/quality-gate.md` — the QA bar that all work must clear
   - `protocols/escalation-rules.md` — when to ask for human input

3. **If the session is a resumption** (not a fresh start), read `checkpoints/in-progress.md` first and then execute `resume-session.md` instead of the above.

4. **If no task is specified and this is a fresh session**, read `planning/task-queue.md` to identify the next piece of work.

5. **Before writing any code**, read the relevant role file in `agents/` and any applicable knowledge doc (system-architecture, design-system, repair-system) per the tiering rules.

## Relationship Between Docs and Tools

- `ai-system/` files are a **cache and summary layer** over the real repository. They provide fast orientation but are never a substitute for ground truth.
- When a doc contradicts what tools/MCP reveal about the actual repo, **trust the tools**. Flag the discrepancy by running `sync-context.md`.
- `ai-system/` files are authoritative for **intent** (architecture decisions, design principles, conventions) — those are not derivable from code alone.
